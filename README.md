### Classy Shoes!

Learning semantical representations using a distributed representation of documents.


## Usage

    ./mkReviews.py

Note: no command line arguments imply querying the german Zalando API; see `./mkReviews.py --help`.

When done, we currently drop you into a interactive console with the trained model at hand.

    >>> model.doesnt_match('sneaker stiefel hemd'.split())
    hemd

    >>> model.most_similar(['stiefel', 'kalt'], ['warm'], topn=3)
    [('schuh', 0.4282079041004181), ('blazer', 0.4223514497280121), ('sneaker', 0.4199856221675873)]

    >>> model.similarity('kleid', 'hemd')
    0.8267573236460305

The same works on document vectors.

    >>> model.docvecs.similarity('M0822D06Q-K11', 'SE652K000-M11')
    0.33098285641485276


Note: do not take the results too seriously at this time.
There is the need for experimentation and fine-tuning: from proper tokenization to parameters for the model.


## What it does

We first fetch all article reviews from the Zalando API.
We then transparently cache reviews and their attributes locally in a SQLite3 database.
As soon as we saved the reviews locally, we train a distributed representation of documents model on reviews and their attributes, learning semantic meaning from their relationships.
Transparently caching the trained model allows us to skip this step in subsequent runs.
